- Project setup and boilerplate cleanup
- Setup - Workspaces & Tooling (setup-phase-1): npm workspaces (`shared`), strict TS base config, ESLint flat config + Prettier, Vitest projects, `@art-gallery/shared` constants. TypeScript pinned to `~6.0.3` because typescript-eslint 8.x supports only `<6.1.0`
- Setup - Express Server Skeleton (setup-phase-2): `server` workspace (Express 5, helmet, credentialed CORS, cookies, `GET /health`), Zod-validated env with fail-fast, `HttpError` + `notFound` + `errorHandler` (body-parser 4xx keep their status as `VALIDATION_ERROR`, unknown → 500 without internals), `validate` middleware (Zod 4 per-field details, `res.locals.validated`), shared `ERROR_CODES` / `ApiErrorBody`. Split `tsconfig.json` (type-checks tests) / `tsconfig.build.json` (emit), new `npm run typecheck`. Toolchain now requires npm 12 (npm 11 dropped native optional deps on install) and Node `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26`; `.gitattributes` forces LF. `tsx watch` picks up `shared/dist` changes without `--include`
